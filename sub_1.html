                                <dt><strong>A choice of those who have a dream!</strong><br>Among many rods in the Magic Eye Series popular since their first launch in 2007, this model was built to basic specification for vertical jigging fishing and offers power comparable to XH and XXH grade. Combining the‘delicate and evolved’carbon fabric and resin, this model maximized the blank elasticity, allowing anyone to perform low-pitch and high-pitch jerking of metal jigs easily and rhythmically. It bends, like a bow, to provide power strong enough to land even the tuna with a weight of more than 50kg without difficulty.</dt>
                                <dd><strong>S-541M (GRIP : 380mm)</strong><br>During vertical jigging fishing that uses spinning reel, the prolonged jerking actions will result in exhaustion of physical strength and fatigue in the shoulder and elbow muscles when the metal jig weighs more than 150g and reel and rod are positioned slightly above the bait reel. The blank, designed in light of such phenomenon, will allow anglers to deal with high-pitch jerking action satisfactorily, including even deep jigging, in a range of depth from shallow to deep(100m or deeper).<br><strong>S-541MH (GRIP : 380mm)</strong><br>This rod is dedicated to vertical jigging, offering the power strong enough to land even the tuna with a weight of more than 50kg, as well as yellowtail amberjack measuring more than 150cm. The unique power allows anglers to land big catch in big game fishing even when heavy metal jig is used in the underwater terrain with rough floor or in the face of fast tidal current.<br><strong>B-541MH (GRIP : 440mm)</strong><br>It increases the ease of high-pitch jerking without strain on the shoulders and arms even during yellowtail amberjack, yellow tail, tuna vertical jigging fishing that involves the use of metal jig with a weight of 130-320g. The blank of rod minimizes complex loads, such as water current resistance and line twist caused by jig and water current resistance caused by main line, even in the water depths of more than 100m.<br><strong>B-541H (GRIP : 440mm)</strong><br>M(Medium) power of rod provides basic action on the vertical jigging fishing rod and can be used by anyone without regard to physique. Meanwhile, H(Heavy) power of rod can be used for sub-equipment. A person who is at least 173cm tall and weighs 70kg can use the H level power of rod for the basic jigging equipment.</dd>
