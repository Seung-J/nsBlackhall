The slender head shape with less resistance reduces fatigue caused by the prolonged fishing during the basic one-pitch jerk action. It is optimized for probing broad layer at a quick pace by curtailing the slide width. It will act as the metal jig dedicated for hairtail in various fields based on the 7 types of performance colors and compact size.</dt>

                                <dt><strong>UMBRAGO KODOK</strong><br>The sliding type balance creates more brilliant and splendid ‘Walking-the-Dog’ action, shifting away from monotonous actions of frog fishing. The front and rear-leg skirt of KODOK creates the silhouette of lures during the pause and action, which resembles a frog every much. The tail fitted with small blade produces satisfactory wave, volume, and flash effects at the same time on murky underwater space and thick cover fishing, clearly appealing to the bass. The 18g KODOK is the optimal weight of frog, which enables targeting the points which have not been reached by casting, and was lauded as the best frog during the testing process, finally leading to its launch.</dt>
