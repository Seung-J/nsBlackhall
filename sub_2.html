                                <dd><strong>S-632 UL-ST (GRIP 180mm)</strong>This model puts an added emphasis on sensitivity. Adopting the 24-ton carbon solid, it increased the transmission of vibration on the fishing rod from the bite by more than 1.5 times. It applied the 9 guides to ensure strong stiffness that hold the blank firm. It is optimized for the fishing tackle operation, such as small rubber jig and down shot, etc., which emphasizes sensitiveness. Adopting the 8-axis carbon(CP 020 4YA-5), this product provides the power strong enough to subdue the targeted fish despite the thin blank.<br><strong>C-652 ML-L-ST (GRIP 210mm)</strong><br>This fishing rod allows anglers to fish with finesse, which is difficult to be achieved with bait rod.Adopting a 24-ton carbon solid, it increased sensitivity by 1.5 times, enabling anglers to figure out any sign of fish bites, although it is a bait rod. It is most suitable for bait finesse fishing, such as small rubber jig, down shot, small minnow, etc. Although it is a finesse rod, it adopted the 8-axis carbon(CP 020 4YA-5) to ensure excellent resilience of rod.<br><strong>C-682 XM (GRIP 250mm)</strong><br>It provides action with medium and medium heavy power of rod, drastically excluding the basic medium power of rod essential for bass fishing. It is a multi-type rod XM that can be used for any points and across the wide spectrum, including the hard bait and soft bait. It provides the most satisfactory performance when using the fast-moving lure of pilot style such as spinner bait, vibration, buzz bait, no-sinker fishing tackle, middle crank bait, etc. Adopting the 8-axis carbon(CP 020 4YA-5), it allows the lure to be pushed quickly during tip action or cast, enabling stable overhead casting and long casting. The strong stiffness(blank) enables strong hook-setting, making the hook driven deeper into the fish’s mouth.<br><strong>C-682 XMH (GRIP 270mm)</strong><br>The strong stiffness, rarely found in major upgraded models of MH(power of rod) for bass anglers, enables even the record-setting catch to be subdued without difficulty. This model is ideal for the lift-and-pull situations basic for the floor fishing, and provides optimal action for operation of fishing tackle such as rubber jig, Texas rig, free rig, heavy down shot, etc. This product was designed as a model with a powerful rod blank, providing excellent maneuverability, balance, sensitivity, etc.</dd>

Professional rainbow trout fishing, using the spoon lure and crank bait, have recently gained popularity. This model was developed to be lighter, sturdier, and better detect the delicate vibration, rather than being simply soft. Featuring even more specialized specification, this new-concept rod will allow anglers to gain even more pleasant rainbow trout fishing experience in the managed fishing ground and in the tournament.</dt>
                                <dd><strong>ARCO S-602 UL (GRIP 120mm)</strong><br>This model was designed for use of lightweight spoon lure weighing about 2g. Delicate vibration transmission on smooth tip and back of rod enables immediate tip reaction to the sensitive trout’s bite of bait during the reeling motion of spoon lure, resulting in faster hook setting and greater success in striking the fish. The back of rod, contrasting to the smooth tip, is sturdy enough to provide power necessary to subdue medium and large rainbow trout. It is also optimized for ARCO SR Crank.<br><strong>ARCO S-622 L (GRIP 120mm)</strong><br>This model is a normal type model finding the most wide-ranging applications. It is optimized for rainbow trout-based lures ranging from small spoon or crank bait to bottom lure. It is a normal type light power model that reduced excessive movement and made up for what is lacking during various actions. It can be used from SR to DR range, a main model giving real pleasure of game fishing.</dd>

                                <dt><strong>The ever-evolving boron-based SSO MINNOWING Rod provides optimal sensitivity and operability, allowing the users to figure out stream flow easily!</strong><br>SSO MINNOWING Rod has evolved to such a point that it adopted boron fiber. We asked our lab to develop boron fiber in 2013 when SSO MINNOWING Rod was planned for the first time. But we gave up on the use of boron fiber after it turned out that the fiber was in short supply and that the carbon fiber could also create dynamic movements of blank as much as desired. No answer could be found easily to these challenging questions, “How can we develop a fishing rod accommodating to the never-stopping flow of stream?” and “How can we achieve both operability and sensitivity?” Leopard is the rod that offered close answer that none of other SSO MINNOWING could. Leopard combines the sensitivity of FINESSE PLUS and excellent operability of TYPHOON LIMITED and has the following features .<br>1. BORON FIBER : There was an increase in straightness of rod, not easily bendable even in the face of major flow, as shown by the data obtained by testing various reinforcement techniques applying high tensile strength of boron fiber. Through that, we achieved ultimate operability based on excellent resilience of top section. It is also fitted with robust butt power allowing you to maintain control over big fish in the fast water.<br>2. 40t CARBON FIBER : Sensitivity, achieved by high elasticity, is very important for anglers to feel the bites of fish or vibrations from the bait trapped beneath the seafloor. Leopard Carbon Mix used 40t carbon basically to maximize sensitivity in both fore grip section and rear grip section, and is finished with exquisite workmanship to maximize resilience of tip section and prevent the risk of damage, thus eliminating the greatest problem in high elasticity rods.<br>3. Harmony between modernity and classics : We proposed the standard design for Korean style mandarin fish rod, which featured the FINESSE PLUS grip design on the base, end grip made of carbon mono cork in two color tones, expressing eternally unchangeable beautifulness, and bee-tree to create a classical feel.</dt>
                                <dd><strong>BMT-5112 / SSO MINNOWING(Minnowing Twitcher) / GIRP 130mm</strong><br>This rod enables optimal twitching of the 35 to 60mm-sized sinking minnow or 1.5m depth minnow measuring 40-60mm with 5'11" quick action in the field from tributary to main stream joining the river. Combining the smoothness and resilience of tip section and robustness of butt, this rod maximized the operability to allow the angler to maintain control over the underwater action of minnow lures under any circumstances. It’s the MINNOWING TWITCHER created only for twitching.<br><strong>BMD-682 / SSO MINNOWING(Minnowing Drifter) / GIRP 150mm</strong><br>The MINNOWING (spoon) drifter optimized for 50 to 70mm-sized 1.5-2m depth minnow simply retrieved or drifted with 5-12g stream spoon in main river and the 50-90mm minnow sunk in the main river zone that has fast current from the main stream with 6'8" quick action(faster than BMT-5112).</dd>

Many people are curious about how the Rods came out first. Back in 2002, when South Korea was hosting the 2002 World Cup, the Korean soccer players played in red uniforms, so they were referred to as "Red Devils". During the World Cup, South Korea was covered with everything in red, which President Kim of NS got inspiration from. Since "Reds" trademark had been already registered, instead NS launched the "Rods" rods in all red, which was then quite rare. Now the Rods is considered as<br>No. 1 for beginners.<br>Can you believe that over 100,000 Rods have been sold so far?<br>The popularity for the Rods is threatening our other fishing rods!<br>KN concept guide (K-Guide concept+Y-Type Guide) High-elasticity Carbon/ Fast type, Ultra lightweight reel seat.</dd>
